复杂度：O(N+M*log(M)) 

where N is the number of elements in the list or set to sort, and M the number of returned elements. When the elements are not sorted, complexity is currently O(N) as there is a copy step that will be avoided in next releases.

其中N是需要排序的list或set中元素的数量，并且M是返回的元素数量。
当元素不排序，复杂性是O（N）。

Returns or stores the elements contained in the list, set or sorted set at key. By default, sorting is numeric and elements are compared by their value interpreted as double precision floating point number. This is SORT in its simplest form:
